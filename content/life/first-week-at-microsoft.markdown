Title: First Week At Microsoft

Subtitle: how I learned to use Outlook and sing karaoke

[Microsoft][] offered me a position as an [SDE][]. I accepted. I have experience
developing on the various Apple platforms and frameworks, and Microsoft is
realigning as a [device and services][] company with some of the most useful
applications offered on Apple platforms.

Thus I started at Microsoft ...

Approximately two-hundred new hires shuffle into the
[Microsoft Visitor Center][] and I am floored at the array of devices to
touch. Think Apple store without the wires. I spend a few minutes playing
[Sonic The Hedgehog][] and reading some random but interesting facts. *Big* and
*humbling*.

Orientation is long.

I have never used a [Surface][] but offer to look up some of the answers for our
group's team building, scavenger hunt bingo quiz. Can not figure out how to turn
on the device. Finially get it on. Never used [Windows 8][]. Can not escape the
[start screen][]. How do I switch from [Word][] to [Internet Explorer][].
Embarased. Ask my neighbor and then realize that everyone at the table has a
[Windows Phone][]. I suddenly feel alone.

I get my blue badge. Orientation is over.

Day two, I meet my manager. I meet the team; setup my computer; start getting
email; and have lunch with some very freindly people. Everyone seems to be
pretty young and everyone seems super smart. We schedule an event for the
weekend: [Karaoke][].

I am in the habbit of reading every email and deleting nothing. I currently have
one "filter" button for my personal account, it's labeled "Report Spam".
Everything else I read. Massive amounts of email and [Outlook][] frightens me. I
am added to half a dozen important [distribution lists][] and suddenly need to
navigate 50+ emails a day, which I suspect, considering this is my first week,
is practically nothing. I learn about rules. I create a few rules.

Meet lots of people. Ask questions. Begin coding. Build project. *Wow*.

[Steve Ballmer][] puts in his 12 month [notice][].

The team invites me to help paint the office of our manager's manager.
Apparantly you shouldn't go on a three-week vacation, know all the words of the
[Aqua][] song [Barbie Girl][], and not expect your office to be painted pink
when you return. My wife paints a 4-foot barbie on the wall.

Realize there is more difference between [AppKit][] and [UIKit][] than I
thought. New challenges are good. Lots of new tools, some good and some
*interesting* chocies. I'll reserve judgement for at least a couple weeks.
Goodbye [Git][].

I try to [longboard][] + bus into work and encounter quite a few hills. More
research needed.

Win one [beach volleyball][] match and then lose two. Join our team's team for
the inter-office [softball][] league, we win one game. Walk past quite an
impressive array of [soccer][] fields, packed with people playing what looks
like [5-a-side][] coed matches. *Excited*.

I begin refactoring some code and learn about Microsoft's coding guidelines.

... which appoximately sums up one week.
