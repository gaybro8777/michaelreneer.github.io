this end of the road comes nearer  
becoming trees on either side  
and footsteps winding among them  
to where the lost men hide  

the sun is high overhead  
shining down through the leaves  
like red-gold waterfalls  
lifted by such slightest breeze  

and there is one skeleton  
propped up as a puppet would be  
leaning back at the end of the road  
for those who reach the end to see  

he could not have gone on  
nor permitted to return home  
too broad to navigate the trees  
and exiled to roam  

so it is said he sat  
relaxed against an old oak  
he must have been without food  
or warmth in shadows cloak  

watching all the fools trudge on  
lost into the wood  
seeing those who stopped  
returning to what homes they could  

because this skeleton  
he was the man who stopped  
he walked the road until the end  
and then against the tree he flopped
