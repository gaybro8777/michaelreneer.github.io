Subtitle: me name is pirate joe flo

me name is pirate joe flow  
and we gotta hacked-up boat  
rowin' and rowin' to shore  
lookin' in me cracked-up scope  

we sail up to me land ho  
and quicken our sped-up float  
with the sails tied tight yo  
and rum in our dried-up throat  

[chorus]  
gotta patch in me eye  
could not see ya baby  
washed up to ya feet  
gotta hope ya save me  
lookin' fer me treasure  
and I saw what I see  
me parrot flew away  
to where me heart may be  

so got me one leg left now  
only it's me lame that's wood  
both me hand are here with five  
to find me treasure I could  

see me right eye is patched  
and on me left shoulder stood  
a parrot that talks more  
than any mate ever would  

two bandanas on me neck  
and mean as a bronze mace  
so when ya come up to me  
I'll rip off and bite ya face  

and in me goes more liquor  
to me gullet with no chase  
more than any man alive  
but two more'll end the race  

[chorus]  

but me boats hung on ya' reef  
crew went and rowed into it  
ya' isle jumped in me path  
me boats where the wind blew it  

and pirate life's got me heart  
black and with a hole through it  
this life was never for me  
though me mates never knew it  

now me crews all bruised-up  
they slippin' into town now  
broken, black, and jacked-up  
draggin' feet from they folly  

see they'll sail to the seven  
without me as they captain  
as ya me island heaven  
pirate life ain't happenin'  

[chorus]  

there's no spittin' fer me now  
no bar hoppin' and no rum  
no booty and no cool thou'  
me devilish work be done  

and now this ta ya I vow  
me pirate life is over  
with me ruckus and me row  
and it is not easy said  

that all the treasure they have  
all the pirates on the sea  
hold nary a water drop  
to the love I have for thee  

so what to say to the sun  
as she sets down on me boat  
say I'll give it all away  
as she keeps me men afloat  

[chorus]
