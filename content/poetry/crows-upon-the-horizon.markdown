Summary: oh sweet cryin' babe<br>
         stepped unto your brave new world<br>
         with apollo on horizon<br>
         and on a shaky voice<br>
         crows calling all the land rejoice<br>
         for the dawning of a newborn<br>

oh sweet cryin' babe  
stepped unto your brave new world  
with apollo on horizon  
and on a shaky voice  
crows calling all the land rejoice  
for the dawning of a newborn  

and with the time goes walkin' by  
great fears that live alone  
valleys casting shadows  
upon yonder mountain home  
with you crowing the horizon  
such time goes bye  

you hang your worries as an angles frown  
not goodbye  
worn on the horizon sky  
and all the weeping people can remember  
is the way you crowed your voice  
oh sweet babe rejoice  
for the setting of a worn one
