so ghouls think they have no homes  
roaming streets and innocents throats  
climbed up beneath from dirt and tombs  
for blood to brave the widest moats  

that you tread so naive and fair  
the darkest of the most rotted roads  
pale skin a dress and jet hair  
certain victim of the ghoulish bodes  

shanty after shack you pass at no pace  
a cool and eerie night it turns  
and a chill to run your bodies lace  
starts a pyre of fear that burns  

then a ghouls caress to touch your skin  
from crawls the deadish maggot worms  
from blooded eyes to rancid grin  
the rotten hand locking your neck affirms  

that you tread so naive and fair  
the darkest of the most rotted roads  
pale skin a dress and jet hair  
certain victim of the ghoulish bodes  

and the moon hears the screaming die  
and the murky night grow silent  
till ghoulish steps near in spry  
and newer fears begin where the cry went
