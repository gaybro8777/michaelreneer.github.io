Title: About

Professional
----------

I am starting to learning [Python][] - it's slowly growing on me, but what I
truly enjoy is working with [Objective-C][] and [Cocoa Touch][], and anything
mobile.

During these last few of years I have helped architect, build, and design:
[iOS][] applications; [ASP.NET MVC][] applications using [C#][], [Razor][],
[HTML5][] and [Javascript][]; [Bash][] scripts; web service layers; [Android][]
applications; and I even flirted with mobile web frameworks like [Sencha][].
I have patented ideas, integrated with social frameworks such as [Twitter][] and
[Facebook][], and became a huge fan of [Git][].

Going back further, I worked with [Flex][], [Java][], and [Maven][] to build
everything from Kiosk software to common application frameworks.

And before that, I spent my time tinkering with [PHP][], [C++][], Java, HTML,
CSS, Javascript, and [Illustrator][] and going to University.

Personal
----------

![Profile Picture][]

I love my family most. My wife can be found selling hand-made quiet books on her
[Etsy][] store [Birdie And Button][] and my daughter is very busy learning to
talk.

I play as much soccer as possible when not playing board games. Many of my
favorite games have strong investing mechanics: [18XX][], [Age of Steam][],
[Hansa Teutonica][], and [Imperial][]; and can take longer then 3 hours to play.

I spend some of my time writing poetry.

Seattle is my new home. I enjoy many outdoor activities: longboarding, mountain
biking, camping, snowshoeing, and snowboarding - though, I prefer snowshoeing to
the others. I do not own a television, I find thought games like the
[dollar auction][] fun, and there is little better then a good [IPA][].

Site
----------

The content of this site is written in [Markdown][] and built with [Pelican][]
using a custom theme I built based on [HTML5 Boilerplate][]. The source and
theme for the [this project][] can be found on [GitHub][] and the site is hosted
on [GitHub Pages][].

In addition to Pelican and Markdown, I am using [Jinja][], [Pygments][],
[webassets][], and [cssmin][] either as a plugin to or as a dependency of
Pelican. To make everything a bit more social I have included the
[Twitter buttons][] and the unofficial [GitHub buttons][].

Thanks.
