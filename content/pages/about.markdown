Title: About

Professional
----------

I am starting to learning [Python][] - it's slowly growing on me, but what I
truly enjoy is working with [Objective-C][] and [Cocoa Touch][], and anything
mobile.

During these last few of years I have helped architect, build, and design:
[iOS][] applications;
[ASP.NET MVC][] applications using [C#][], [Razor][], [HTML5][] and [Javascript][];
[Bash][] scripts;
web service layers;
[Android][] applications;
and I even flirted with mobile web frameworks like [Sencha][].
I have
patented ideas,
integrated with social frameworks such as [Twitter][] and [Facebook][],
and became a huge fan of [Git][].

Going back further, I worked with [Flex][], [Java][], and [Maven][] to build
everything from Kiosk software to common application frameworks.

And before that, my life was an eclectic mix of [PHP][], [C++][], Java, HTML,
CSS, Javascript and University classes.

Personal
----------

![Profile Picture][]

I love my family most. My wife can be found selling hand-made quiet books on her
[Etsy][] store [Birdie And Button][] and my daughter is very busy learning to
talk.

I play as much soccer as possible when not playing board games. Many of my
favorite games have strong investing mechanics: [18XX][], [Age of Steam][],
[Hansa Teutonica][], and [Imperial][]; and can take longer then 3 hours to play.

I spend some of my time writing poetry.

To add, I enjoy, longboarding, mountain biking, camping, snowshoeing, and
snowboarding - though, I prefer snowshoeing to the others. I do not own a
television and I find thought games like the [dollar auction][] fun. I am also
convinced the most difficult part of my job is finding good names for classes,
methods and properties.

Site
----------

The content of this site is written in [Markdown][] and built with [Pelican][]
using a custom theme I built based on [HTML5 Boilerplate][]. The source and
theme for the [this project][] can be found on [GitHub][] and the site is hosted
on [GitHub Pages][].

In addition to Pelican and Markdown, I am using [Jinja][], [Pygments][],
[webassets][], and [cssmin][] either as a plugin to or as a dependency of
Pelican. To make everything a bit more social I have included the
[Twitter buttons][] and the unofficial [GitHub buttons][].

Thanks.
