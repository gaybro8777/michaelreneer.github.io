## Professional

I work at [Microsoft][] developing [Microsoft Office][] on [Apple][] devices
using [Python][], [Objective-C][], [C++][], [Cocoa][] and [Cocoa Touch][].
Mobile applications rock. I love [Terminal][] and [Bash][], and I'm a huge fan
of [Git][].

Before that I helped architect, build, and design: [iOS][] applications;
[ASP.NET MVC][] applications using [C#][], [Razor][], [HTML5][] and
[Javascript][]; bash scripts; web service layers; and I flirted with mobile web
frameworks like [Sencha][]. I have patented ideas and integrated with social
frameworks such as [Twitter][] and [Facebook][].

Going back further, I worked with [Flex][], [Java][], and [Maven][] to build
everything from kiosk software to ui frameworks.

And even further back, I spent my time exploring [PHP][], C++, Java, HTML, CSS
Javascript, and [Illustrator][], and going to University.

## Personal

<!-- ![Profile Picture][] -->

I love my family most. My wife can be found selling hand-made quiet books on her
[Etsy][] store [Birdie And Buttons][]. My oldest daughter is very busy learning
to swim and my younger one is often following my oldest around.

I play as much soccer as possible when not playing board games. Many of my
favorite board games have strong investing mechanics: [18XX][],
[Age of Steam][], [Hansa Teutonica][], and [Imperial][], and can take longer
than 3 hours to play.

I spend some of my time writing poetry.

[Seattle][] is my home. I enjoy many outdoor activities: longboarding, mountain
biking, camping, snowshoeing, and snowboarding - I prefer snowshoeing to the
others. I do not own a television, I find thought games like the
[dollar auction][] fun, and there is little better than a good [IPA][].

## Site

The content of this site is written in [Markdown][] and built with [Jekyll][]
using a custom theme I created based on [HTML5 Boilerplate][]. I am using
[Bootstrap][] and [Normalize][] to implement a [mobile first][] design. The
source and theme for [this site][] can be found on [GitHub][], and the site
is hosted on [GitHub Pages][].

In addition to Jekyll, Markdown, and all the cool HTML and CSS tech, I am using
[YAML][], [Liquid][], and [Rouge][] either as a plugin for, or as a dependency
of, Jekyll.

Thanks.
