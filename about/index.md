title: About
---

I work on machine learning at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) and before that I
worked at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) developing mobile applications.

I love my family more than everything else in the world combined. My wife
is an artist. My oldest daughter is very busy learning; my middle daughter has
some awesome dance moves; and my youngest daughter is endlessly asking why.

I play soccer and board games in my free time;
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) is awesome;
[dollar auctions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) are fun; and
[Seattle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seattle) is my home.
