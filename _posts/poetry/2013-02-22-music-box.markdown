oh music box of the ocean  
you washed ashore in mystery  
pushed overboard in commotion  
oh you were lost far out at sea  
now you caress the sand again  
for those who walk the shore to see  
you sing of all those travels when  
you fell amidst the ships debris  

oh music box of the ocean  
look how those clouds are walking by  
viewing sunlight in slow motion  
not caring what you are or why  
the beach is full of things like this  
the people walking by they say  
oh what could a box reminisce  
then like those clouds they walk away  

oh music box of the ocean  
a day will come when your skies clear  
and he lays down in emotion  
he's just begging his heart to hear  
you pour open your lullaby  
when you share all that you fear  
it's why the sun shines in the sky  
because your smile lasts a year  

oh music box of the ocean  
oh he'll do anything for you  
he'll dig away all the old sand  
and make you laugh when your heart's blue  
will you sing now that you are free  
he won't wander where those clouds blew  
and you've returned from the sea  
you now know your journey is through
