once upon the loaded lorry  
the peel would meet her fate  
who use to guard a juicy treat  
that recently was ate  

and lifted through the back alley  
and all of that would change  
and friends piled on her shoulders  
the lot of whom was strange  
and together they would approach  
and leave the city behind  
and find they were dumped in a pile  
beside some old cheese rind  

long forgotten and long dismissed  
but something magic too  
do not cry for the lovely peel  
and where the orange tree grew
