and here is a wonderful tale of two  
a most beautiful lady fairy-girl  
twinkly wings and a singing kazoo  
and with her a big big monster dragon  
he would only eat piles of brussels  
and she liked to grow them by the wagon  

they were adventuring the iron wood  
the deepest and darkest spidery nooks  
where the fair folk feared in all likelihood  
something had stolen the schools saxophone  
where they met a mouse and a butterfly  
having their tea and a blueberry scone  

have you seen anything odd around here  
only the sun and the grass is green  
and the fairy-girl laughed their answer queer  
and the monster dragon said to grassie  
have you seen any scary goings-on  
maybe near the old sea plane chassis  

and on and on they went asking about  
they got lost in a mucky mushroom patch  
the fairy-girl climbed up an old bean-sprout  
the monster dragon swam in lava fire  
and they could not find the musical thing  
so they could not fix the fair folks choir  

they were adventuring the iron wood  
and they returned to the town empty handed  
only to be very surprised where they stood  
for all the town was dancing and smiles  
and a fair tune floated in from the park  
and there were wisps in the skies for miles  

there was a simple misunderstanding  
no one had stolen the schools saxophone  
no mysterious ransom demanding  
it was a beautiful happy birthday  
and every little magic invited  
because wisp was growing oder today
